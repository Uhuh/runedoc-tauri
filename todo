For typical web font sizing, here’s a standard set of proportions you can use as a guide:

    Body (Paragraph): 1rem (usually 16px).
    H1: 2.5rem to 3rem (2.5–3 times the base size).
    H2: 2rem (2 times the base size).
    H3: 1.75rem (1.75 times the base size).
    H4: 1.5rem (1.5 times the base size).
    H5: 1.25rem (1.25 times the base size).
    H6: 1rem (same as the base size for paragraphs).

These sizes create a natural visual hierarchy and make your content easier to read. You can also adjust the line-height to about 1.5 for paragraphs and 1.25 for headers to keep everything well-spaced.
